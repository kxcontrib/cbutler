==================================================
v0.2.0 - 2012/10/01
==================================================
- Added live updating charts
- Added Flot and jqPlot charting API's as a replacement for Google Charts API. They are lighter and quicker to load than Google.
- Added many other supporting functions
- Ability to save charts as images
- Ability to print charts directly
- Ability to pause updating charts
- Created https://bitbucket.org/carlosbutler/charts-for-kdb to replace http://code.google.com/p/kdbchart/

- Changed the CSVtoJSONRowArray function so that it actually works as intended this time round. As an addition, it now allows one to state as two extra parameters:
* whether the CSV has column names
* should the column names be returned
* The parser is more thorough with data types now
- Changed the Instructions webpage, and added more detail
- Changed the name of the API from KdbChart to Charts for kdb+
- Changed logo

- Removed Google Charts API as this has no live update features. Attempting to redraw the graph by loading it again created flickering charts.
- Stop use of http://code.google.com/p/kdbchart/
